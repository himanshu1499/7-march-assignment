    "Measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation are used to describe the spread or variability of a dataset. They provide information on how tightly or loosely the data is clustered around the central tendency measures like mean, median, or mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It provides a simple measure of the spread of the dataset. For example, if the range of a dataset is large, it indicates that the data points are spread out over a wide range of values. Conversely, if the range is small, it indicates that the data points are clustered closer together. For instance, consider the heights of students in a class where the tallest student is 190 cm and the shortest is 150 cm. The range of the dataset is 190 - 150 = 40 cm, indicating that the heights of students are quite varied.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variance: The variance is the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean of the dataset. It measures the spread of the dataset around the mean. A high variance indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range of values, while a low variance indicates that the data points are clustered closely around the mean. For example, if we have a dataset of test scores for a class of students, and the variance of the scores is high, it means that the performance of the students varied widely, whereas a low variance indicates that the performance of the students was relatively consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Standard deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It is a popular measure of dispersion because it has the same units as the original data, making it easy to interpret. A high standard deviation indicates that the data points are more spread out, while a low standard deviation indicates that the data points are clustered closely around the mean. For example, suppose we have a dataset of ages for a group of people, and the standard deviation of ages is 10 years. This indicates that the ages of the people in the group vary widely, and most people are 10 years away from the average age of the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, measures of dispersion are useful in providing additional information about the variability of data points in a dataset beyond the central tendency measures. They can help identify whether the data is tightly clustered around the mean or spread out over a wide range of values, which is important for making informed decisions based on the data."

    "This outlier has significantly increased the mean, as it is much larger than the other values in the dataset. The median, however, is still 85, as it is not influenced by extreme values. The range has also increased from 40 to 90, due to the addition of the outlier. Finally, the variance and standard deviation have also increased, indicating that the data is more spread out than before. \n",

    "Therefore, it is important to be aware of outliers and their potential impact on measures of central tendency and dispersion, and to consider their removal or handling when analyzing data."
